        Prepare a medium saucepan, set the stove in medium heat. Pour milk and
        warm it until it is simmering. Turn off heat and set it aside.

      <li>
        In a pan, melt the butter over medium heat. Whisk in the flour and cook
        the mixture, whisking constantly, until it turns light brown in color
        and has a slightly toasted aroma, for about 3 minutes.
      </li>

      <li>
        Turn off heat, slowly whisk the warm milk into the flour mixture, and
        continue whisking to avoid any lumps. The mixture will become very thick
        and then thin out gradually until it is smooth.

        Return the pot to the stove over medium high heat and cook the mixture
        while whisking constantly until it has thickened enough to coat the back
        of a spoon, about 2 minutes.
